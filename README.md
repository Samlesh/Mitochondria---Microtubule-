# Mitochondria---Microtubule-
Codes for M1,M2 and M2MT models
# Model description
In all models , binning.m  referes to the program which partitions the mitochondrial lengths obtained from experiment into 20 different length fragments.
# M1 model
In M1 model, .mat files refers to the length data obtained from experiments.Every microtubule state has two .m files, one calling function and the other backend function which executes the mitochondrial dynamics.
# M2 model
In M1 model, .mat files refers to the length data obtained from experiments.Every microtubule state has two .m files, one calling function and the other backend function which executes the mitochondrial dynamics.
# Microtubule design
This module consists of simulation of short, wild-type and long microtubules
# M2MT model
The M2MT model consists of matlab codes which has coupled mitochondria and microtubule dynamics.
# General abbreviations
(1) nmt: no microtubules (2) smt: small microtubules 
(3) wmt: wild-type microtubules (4) lmt: long microtubules
